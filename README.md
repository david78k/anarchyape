AnarchyApe
==========

Fault injection tool for hadoop cluster from yahoo anarchyape


Compilation 
-----------
1. Use IntelliJ

   Select target `anarchy_ape[package]`,run the target, then you can get `anarchy_ape.jar` in the `target` directory.

2. Use Maven

   `mvn package`

### [Optional] Build perl library

[Perl]

```
   perl Makefile.PL
   cpan -i JSON
   make
   make test
   make install
```

Running 
-------
[Java]

```
java -jar ape.jar [commands]
```

log file: /var/log/ape.log

Example:

```
java -jar ape.jar -L -S 100 5
```
Runs in the local and injects slow network with delay 100 milliseconds for 5 seconds.

(Remote run)
Install pdsh:

```
yum install pdsh
apt-get install pdsh

java -jar ape.jar -R node1,node2,node3 -S 100 5
creates a script to run on the remote hosts:
pdsh -Rssh -w node1,node2,node3 '/usr/local/bin/ape -L -S 100 5'
```

It seems not working as the remote hosts do not have /usr/local/bin/ape file.

Remote nodes can be specified in XML format: cluster-ip-list.xml

Currently, to create a scenario, the user constructs a shell
script specifying the types of errors to be injected or failures to be simulated, one after another. A sample line in a
scenario file could be as follows:

```
java -jar ape.jar -remote cluster-ip-list.xml -F lambda -k lambda
	where the -F is a “Fork Bomb” injection, the -k is a “Kill
	One Node” command, and the lambda specifies the failure rates.
```
Users can define lambda parameters by computing Mean
Time Between Failures (MTBF) of a system. MTBF is defined to be the average (or expected) lifetime of a system
and is one of the key decision-making criteria for data center infrastructure systems [1]. Equipment in data centers
is going to fail, and MTBF helps with predicting which systems are the likeliest to fail at any given moment. Based on
previous failure statistics, users can develop an estimate of
MTBF for various equipment failures; however, determining
MTBFs for many software failures is challenging.
